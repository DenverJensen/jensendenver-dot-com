# Intro

I am a Front-End Developer for [Discover Financial Services](https://discover.com) where I build tools to support business workflow and employee performance measurement. I am graduating from [Weber State University](https://weber.edu) at the end of the year.  I am particularly interested in JavaScript and front-end development. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.
 
# Currently

At Discover, I have learned how to work as a team, manage relationships, shape culture, sell enterprise products, and build on-line interactive tools using [React](https://react.js). I primarily work as a Front-End Developer but have broad experience across Discover's stack including Node.js and MySQL.

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in the basement around 1997 when I was 7. It was a teal blue imac. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Tom and Jerry and Weekend Warrior. 

- I was nominated to be in charge of the school computer lab at my middle school. That mostly just meant I was in charge of turning the computers on and off at the beginning and end of each day, but I appreciated the responsibility.

- We subscribed to the internet in the late 90's. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- As a teenager, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.

- At 25, I discovered my lover for progamming as I took my Intro to Java class. I have been hooked ever since.

- I am now graduating with a degree in Computer Science to continue pursuing my dreams as a developer.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
